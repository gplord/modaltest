# Modal Test

Test implementation of PIC modal, pre-Sitecore

## Overview

This page should load a modal on first page load, and set a cookie expiring two weeks later. Additional page loads will check for that cookie and skip the modal if it's found.  Other pages in this section (see Page Two link above) will share the cookie.  

* Press the red button to delete the cookie and re-test.
                
* Modal code is custom for now, can be replaced with any library for better compatibility. 

* Styles are approximate and animations are placeholder, can be replaced with whatever standard animations might exist).

* Check js console for debug output on cookie setting/datetime/retrieval.
